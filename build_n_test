# Builds everything with all configured compilers and runs the tests under given
# OpenCL platforms for each of the compilers.
#
# Assumes that each compiler has its own build directory which is named
# 'build-<compiler id>'. As an example, here is what I have:
# build-4.6.4 -- g++-4.6.4
# build-4.7.3 -- g++-4.7.3
# build-4.8.1 -- g++-4.8.1
# build-clang -- current clang

# Stop on errors:
set -e

# Make with every configured compiler:
parallel --ungroup make -C ::: build-*

# List of platforms to test:
available_platforms="NVIDIA Intel Portable AMD"

# Run tests for each OpenCL platform ...
for platform in ${available_platforms}; do
    # ... built with every possible compiler:
    for compiler in build-*; do
        echo
        echo "----------------------------------------------------------------------"
        echo "OCL_PLATFORM=${platform} compiler=${compiler}"
        echo "----------------------------------------------------------------------"
        echo
        OCL_PLATFORM=${platform} make -C ${compiler} test
    done
done
